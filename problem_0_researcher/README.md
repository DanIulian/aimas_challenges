# The researcher's challenge

You have just been hired by a hot technology start-up looking to expand their AI and Machine Learning products and features. As their new **Head of Research**, you have to organize your new team such that you will deliver at the end of the next 6 months a first prototype allowing for a software application to use hand gestures control (based on inputs from an RGB camera). Management has not yet decided the embodiment of this technology (standalone app or SDK) or even the platforms it will support (PC, mobile or custom embedded device).

Your task is to convey your vision to your team, through a (max) 2 page essay in which you highlight both the research and development challenges which lie ahead. Donâ€™t forget about analyzing the problem and mention:

* 3 problems and challenges that the proposed algorithms will face
* 3 development challenges that might arise during implementation
* A step-by-step plan (as detailed as you see fit) which sets the roadmap for delivering a robust and impressive first prototype
